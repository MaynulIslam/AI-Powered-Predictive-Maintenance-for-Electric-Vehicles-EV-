# AI-Powered-Predictive-Maintenance-for-Electric-Vehicles-EV-
Build an AI system that monitors electric vehicle components (batteries, motors, etc.) and predicts potential issues before they occur.

**Technologies:** Predictive Analytics, Machine Learning, IoT
**Goals:** Prevent breakdowns and reduce maintenance costs by predicting issues early.

**Milestones:**
Collect data from EV components using IoT sensors.
Develop a machine learning model for predictive maintenance.
Test the system on historical data and refine it based on feedback.

**Tools and Technologies to Consider:**
Programming Languages: Python, C++, TensorFlow, PyTorch
Automotive Simulators: CARLA, OpenAI Gym
APIs: Google Maps API, Vehicle Telemetry APIs, IoT Platforms
Data: Use datasets from open-source platforms like Kaggle for training and testing.
